I have baked a custom integration for BWT Perla Water Softener. You need to learn IP address of your machine and respective code to access web ui.

Warning ahead; this is pre-alpha phase, please do not expect something fully functional, I will improve the integration by time.

You can install this either manually copying files or using HACS. Configuration can be done on UI, you need to enter your host (ip address) and code.
