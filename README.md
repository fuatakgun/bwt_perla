I have baked a custom integration to control Eufy Security Cameras and access RSTP (real time streaming protocol) stream if possible. You can turn on and turn off cameras and if your camera is on, you can view live stream. Morevoer, there are some additional sensors for motion detection, person detection, battery level and wifi signal.

Installation;
 This integration relies on [eufy-security-ws](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws) to communicate with cloud and local endpoints which means that you need to setup a local npm server and you need to configure this custom integration to communicate with that npm server.

 In simple steps;
 1- Download Node over here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ - If you have Node-Red running already, it means you have this.
 2- Checkout latest codebase of eufy-security-ws: `git clone https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws`
 3- Previous command will create a folder named as eufy-security-ws, now change your directory into it`cd eufy-security-ws`
 4- Create a file here named as `config.json` and edit it using this `nano config.json`
 5- Fill this file with these format `{"username": "email@address.com", "password": "password_goes_here"}`
 6- Save and exit using Ctrl+X and Yes
 7- Execute these commands
    ```
    npm install
    npm install typescript ts-node
    npx ts-node .\src\bin\server.ts
    ```
8- Your local eufy security server should be up and running in port 3000.
9- Install home assistant integration and set eufy security server's host name and port using UI.
10- Raise your issues in Github.
